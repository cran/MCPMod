    * Removed superfluous control argument for getInit function

    * Added a note in the documentation of MCPMod function
    regarding the returned nls objects.

    * Corrected getGrad function (gradient of exponential,
    sigEmax and betaMod model).

2008-11-17 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Synchronized defaults for off parameter in fullMod
    (0.1*max(doses) instead of 1).

    * getPars: Removed bug with a negative maximum effect
    for quadratic model.

2008-07-11 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Edited getTstat and fitModel function to allow for
    dose-groups with only 1 patient (replace NA in estimate
    of group variance with 0).

    * Removed clinRel line from output of summary.MCPMod, when
    doseEst = "ED".

2008-05-06 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Include José's comments for output of MCPMod and sampSize
    (include name of dose estimator and summary function)

    * guesst: Removed bug in the check of 0 < p <= 1. (Bracket
    closed to early.)
