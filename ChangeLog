    * Adapted control argument to have class GenzBretz to reflect
    changes in mvtnorm package.
    * Removed some example code using \dontrun{} to reduce check
    time.

2009-10-05 Bjoern Bornkamp
    * Code now checks the 'models' argument whether there are
    multiple list entries for a model class (in functions modelMeans
    and fullMod) and stops if this is the case (only one list entry
    allowed per model class).

    * Removed problem in powerMM function when only one model
    is in the candidate set (added a drop = FALSE).

2009-09-17 Bjoern Bornkamp
    * Removed superfluous line of code in guesst function
    (for exponential model) (thanks to Misha Salganik)

    * For two-sided testing use max |T_m| as test statistic,
    before by mistake max T_m was used also in two-sided case
    (thanks to Daniel Gerhard)

    * Minor changes in getInitBeta function (replaced "names(m)"
    directly with "dose"), due to changes in R the old
    version did not run anymore.

2009-03-04 Bjoern Bornkamp
    * Corrected typo in the getGrad function (gradient of
    sigEmax model).

2009-02-11 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Minor changes in documentation and inclusion of vignette.

2009-02-02 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Minor changes in documentation to comply with new Rd parser.

2008-12-18 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Removed superfluous control argument for getInit function

    * Added a note in the documentation of MCPMod function
    regarding the returned nls objects.

    * Corrected getGrad function (gradient of exponential,
    sigEmax and betaMod model).

2008-11-17 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Synchronized defaults for off parameter in fullMod
    (0.1*max(doses) instead of 1).

    * getPars: Removed bug with a negative maximum effect
    for quadratic model.

2008-07-11 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Edited getTstat and fitModel function to allow for
    dose-groups with only 1 patient (replace NA in estimate
    of group variance with 0).

    * Removed clinRel line from output of summary.MCPMod, when
    doseEst = "ED".

2008-05-06 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Include José's comments for output of MCPMod and sampSize
    (include name of dose estimator and summary function)

    * guesst: Removed bug in the check of 0 < p <= 1. (Bracket
    closed to early.)


2008-04-22 Bjoern Bornkamp

    * Excluded some examples from checking to reduce check time.
